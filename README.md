**Summary:** Dr. Kaitlin Torphy, Dr. Ken Frank, and Hamid Karimi will join us from the Teachers in Social Media Project at Michigan State University to speak about an emergent phenomenon, social media in education.  The talk will present the notion of a Fifth Estate within the digital age, redefining network influence. As power and influence are negotiated across executive, judicial, and legislative enterprises, media—the Fourth Estate, and networks of influence amongst individuals within the Fifth Estate, present a new form of educational professionalism. Here, educators, researchers, and the community may engage directly in virtual space. Dr. Frank will present the importance of curation within social media and what we can learn from teachers’ digital traces. Dr. Torphy will present research regarding teachers’  engagement within Pinterest, a prevalent social media platform amongst teachers nationwide. Using both quantitative descriptive and causal estimation approaches, she will present entrepreneurial behaviors within education—the teacherpreneur— and their response to the Common Core State Standards, a federal education reform. Finally, Hamid Karimi will present early efforts to extend characterization of instructional quality at scale using computer science approaches in machine learning.

**Ken Frank** received his Ph.D. in measurement, evaluation and statistical analysis from the School of Education at the University of Chicago in 1993.  He is MSU Foundation professor of Sociometrics, professor in Counseling, Educational Psychology and Special Education; and adjunct (by courtesy) in Fisheries and Wildlife and Sociology at Michigan State University.  His substantive interests include the study of schools as organizations, social structures of students and teachers and school decision-making, and social capital.  His substantive areas are linked to several methodological interests: social network analysis, sensitivity analysis and causal inference (http://konfound-it.com), and multi-level models. His publications include quantitative methods for representing relations among actors in a social network, robustness indices for sensitivity analysis for causal inferences, and the effects of social capital in schools, natural resource management, and other social contexts.  Dr. Frank’s current projects include how beginning teachers’ networks affect their response to the Common Core; how schools respond to increases in core curricular requirements; school governance; teachers’ use of social media https://www.teachersinsocialmedia.com/); implementation of the Carbon-Time science curriculum (http://carbontime.bscs.org/); epistemic network analysis (http://www.epistemicnetwork.org/); social network intervention in natural resources and construction management; complex decision-making in health care; and the diffusion of knowledge about climate change.

**Kaitlin Torphy** Ph.D. is the Lead Researcher and Founder of the Teachers in Social Media Project at Michigan State University. This project considers the intersection of cloud to class, nature of resources within virtual resource pools, and implications for equity as educational spaces grow increasingly connected. Dr. Torphy conceptualizes the emergence of a teacherpreneurial guild in which teachers turn to one another for instructional content and resources. She has expertise in teachers’ engagement across virtual platforms, teachers’ physical and virtual social networks, and education policy reform. Dr. Torphy was a co-PI and presenter for an American Education Research Association conference convened in October 2018 at Michigan State University on social media and education. She has published work on charter school impacts, curricular reform, teachers’ social networks, and presented work regarding teachers’ engagement within social media at the national and international level. Her other work examines diffusion of sustainable practices across social networks within The Nature Conservancy. Dr. Torphy earned a Ph.D. in education policy, a specialization in the economics of education from Michigan State University in 2014 and is a Teach for America alumni and former Chicago Public Schools teacher.

**Hamid Karimi** is a fourth-year Ph.D. student of Computer Science at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at Michigan State University (MSU) and a member of the Data Science and Engineering (DSE) lab. He obtained his B.S. (2010) in Computer Engineering from the University of Isfahan and his M.S. (2012) in Information Technology from Urmia University. His Ph.D. advisor is Dr. Jiliang Tang – an assistant professor of Computer Science and Engineering. His research interests are in machine learning, data mining, natural language processing, social network analysis, and misinformation detection. He is an active member of the Teachers in Social Media Project at MSU where he develops data mining and machine learning models and algorithms to characterize instructional resources in online social media. Mr. Karimi has published several papers in the top conferences and journals on networking, social network analysis, big data, and machine learning, and has several other papers under review. He received several awards including the best paper award for his paper presented at 2018 IEEE-ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, which is one of the top conferences in social network analysis; the MSU Engineering Leadership Fellowship for directing undergraduate summer research and education in the College of Engineering at MSU; the best Student Service Award from the CSE department at MSU; and the best poster award in the MSU Engineering Symposium 2019.
